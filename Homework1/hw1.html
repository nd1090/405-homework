  <h1>Noor-Aldean Deek  -  Undeclared </h1>

  <p>I'm taking this course because I'm interested in html and other computing things. I'd like to possibly major in CS or CIS</p>

        </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Unordered List Element
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" target="_blank">Official Unordered List Element Document</a></li>
      <li>Attributes
        <ul>
          <li>compact: This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user agent and it doesn't work in all browsers.</li>
          <li>Type: Used to set the bullet style for the list.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Attributes
        <ul>
          <li>download: This attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it, so the user will be prompted to save it as a local file. If the attribute has a value, it is used as the pre-filled file name in the Save prompt (the user can still change the file name if they want). There are no restrictions on allowed values, though / and \ are converted to underscores. Most file systems limit some punctuation in file names, and browsers will adjust the suggested name accordingly.</li>
          <li>href: Contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink points to.</li>
          <li>ping: Contains a space-separated list of URLs to which, when the hyperlink is followed, post requests with the body ping will be sent by the browser (in the background). Typically used for tracking</li>

        <ul>
          <li>alt: This attribute defines an alternative text description of the image.</li>
          <li>Crossorigin: This enumerated attribute indicates if the fetching of the related image must be done using CORS or not.</li>
